## Rasperry_pi-DHT11
Image raspberry_pi-DHT11 shows how the DHT11 sensor is connected to the raspberry pi using three different cables. The green cable 
is connected from 3,3 out to the most left pin on the sensor. The grey cable is connected from pin zero to the second pin from the left on the sensor while the blue cable is connected from grond to the fourth pin from the left. There is also a 10k resistor connected between the green and the grey cables. 

## Raspberry_pi-CCS811
3,3 Volt is connected to "3,3V" on the sensor. Ground is connected to "gnd" on the sensor. A cable from pin 4 is connected to "SDA" on the sensor. A cable from pin 5 is connected to "ADS" on the sensor.


## Raspberry_pi-battery
Place the breadboard power supply on the edge of the breadboard so that the possitive and negative pins on the power supply match the breadboards possitive and negative lines. Connect a cable from the negative line to ground on the raspberry pi. Connect a cable from the possitive line to pin 39 (vsys) on the raspberry pi.


## Complete setup
To complete the setup you combien the three steps above on one breadboard and with one raspberry pi.
