## Raspberry pi pico w
Rasberry Pi pico is small but powerfull micro controller. Rasperrby pi pico w has 26 GPIO- pins a RISC-V-processor and micro-USB port for data transmission. A micro controller is a small type of computer which has a specific designed hardware and software for the purpose of exicuting different tasks. 



## Dust sensor optic GP2Y1010AU0F 
The dust sensor optic GP2Y1010AU0F is a air quality sensor that measures the amount of fine dust particals in the air. For the sensor to be able to determine the amount of dust in the air the sensor emittes infrared light. The reflected infrared light is then measured so that the sensor could calculate the amount of dust. The dust sensor can detect dust particals which has a diameter larger than 0.3 micrometers. 


## Digital temperatur- och fuktsensor DHT11 
 The sensor DHT11 is a digital sensor which can measure temperature and humidity. The sensor can calculate both temperaure and humidity with almost precise accuracy. Also, DHT11 is digital and uses a digital singlal to which the sensor can commute with the microcontroller. DHT11 operates at 3-5 voltage and can measure temperature at a range of 0-50 celsius and 20-90% relative humidity aswell. 

## SEN-14193 - CCS811 luftkvalitetssensordelning
The CCS811 is a digital Air quality sensor meant for measuring indoor air quality, the sensor have the ability to sense a large amount of different toxic gases such as corbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and acetone. CCS811 can sense the different levels of these toxic gases often catagorized as polluntants. These different gases can come from a wide range of different sources, for example machines, paint and different constructions materials. 

## Breadboard
A breadboards is a device used for building prototypes for test circuits. With breadboard we have the availability to make a large variety of electronic systems by connecting the legs of the different components such as microcontrollers, LEDS and resistors which can be placed into the holes of the breadboard. The different sets of holes on the breadboard connected by a metalstrip makes a node. This can be done by connecting the different components legs in a common node. 


## Breadboard power supply
A breadboard power supply is a unit used for providing current to different kinds of electronic devices and components that is connected to a breadboard. The breadboard power supply provides current in different types of voltage and can have multiple power sources depending on types of components.
