### Task 1

#### A Base system

#### B Ping between pc

TODO: Describe why the dont work

![router1](T1b-router1.png)

#### C Network module

TODO: Describe the network modules.

#### D Subnet

A /24 subnet has 254 usable addresses. 256 total, 1 for the network and 1 for broadcast. Sutiable for local area networks with multiple devices.

A /30 subnet has 2 usable addresses. 4 total, 1 for the network and 1 for broadcast. Sutiable for point to point network.

### Task 2

#### A ip route

ip route [ip] [mask] [router_interface] [metric]

[ip] The target network for the static route

[mask] The subnet mask for the destination network

[router_interface] The address for the next router

[metric] The cost of the route

#### B Traceroute pc

![t2b](T2b-pc1.png)

The path is R1 -> R4 -> R5 due to how the metric is used. Where the bandwidth 100Mbps gives a 1 as metric, 10 Mbps gives 2 av metric and 1544kbps gives a 3. R1 first chooses one of the two available routers with 1 as metric and then follows that path which in this case is the path through R4.

![T2b](T2b-pc3.png)

The path is R5 -> R3 -> R2 -> R1 due to how the metrics are used. R5 first chooses the path with the lowest metric which is the path through r3 and r2 to R1.

#### C Path shutdown

#### D Path shutdown, new path

![tracepc1-pc3](T2d-Tracepc1-pc3.png)

The packages starts taking the route R1 -> R4 -> R5. When that route is shutdown four packages are lost untill the new route R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R5 is found. This new route is choosen as the metric for the path is the new lowest.

![tracepc3-pc2](T2d-Tracepc3-pc2.png)

The packages starts taking the route R5 -> R3 -> R2 -> R1. When the route is shutdown two packages are lost untill the new route R5 -> R1 is found. This new route is choosen as the metric for the path is the lowest.

### Task 3

#### A RIP path

![pc1RIP](T3a-pc1RIP.png)

RIP selects the best path depending on the amount of routers the packages needs to pass through to get to the destination. The path R1 -> R5 is the best as it has 1 hop while the path R1 -> R4 -> R5 has 2 hops and the path R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R5 has 3 hops.

![pc3RIP](T3a-pc3RIP.png)

The path R5 -> R1 is the best as it has 1 hop while the path R5 -> R4 -> R1 has 2 hops and the path R5 -> R3 -> R2 -> R1 has 3 hops.

#### B RIP new path

![pc1-RIP-shut](T3b-pc1-RIP-shut.png)

When the path R1 -> R5 is shutdown the new path is the path with the lowest amounts of hops which is the path R1 -> R4 -> R5.

![pc3-RIP-shut](T3b-pc3-RIP-shut.png)

When the path R5 -> R1 is shutdown the new path is the path with the lowest amounts of hops which is the path R5 -> R4 -> R1.

### Task 4

#### A OSPF metric

OSPF uses cost as a metric. The cost is calculated as cost = (Refernece Bandwidth) / (Link Bandwidth)

The default Reference Bandwidth is 100Mbps. The lowest cost is the path R1 <-> R2 <-> R3 <-> R5, and the highest cost is the path R1 <-> R4 <-> R5.

The path R1 <-> R5 has the cost 10. The path R1 <-> R2 <-> R3 <-> R5 has the cost of 3. The path R1 <-> R4 <-> R5 has and approximate cost of 66.

#### B OSPF new path

![pc1-ospf](T4a-pc1-ospf.png)

The lowest cost is first the path R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R5 and when that path is shutdown the new lowest costing path is R1 -> R5 which is why that path is now choosen.

![pc3-ospf](T4a-pc3-ospf.png)

The lowest cost is first the path R5 -> R3 -> R2 -> R1 and when that path is shutdown the new lowest costing path is R5 -> R1 which is why that path is now choosen.

### Task 5
