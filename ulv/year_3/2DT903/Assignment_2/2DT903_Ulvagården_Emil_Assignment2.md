### Part 1

```Powershell

Rin = R1 + ((R2 + R4) * (R3 + R5)) / ((R2 + R4) + (R3 + R5))

Rf = R6

gclosed = -(Rf / Rin)

gclosed = -(R6 / (R1 + ((R2 + R4) * (R3 + R5)) / ((R2 + R4) + (R3 + R5))))

=> Vout = gclosed * Vin = -(R6 / (R1 + ((R2 + R4) * (R3 + R5)) / ((R2 + R4) + (R3 + R5)))) * Vin
```

### Part 2

![UML diagram of task 2](./UML/Task_2.png)

```Powershell

X = [x2, x1, x0]

0 <= N <= 7 # (000) <= N <= (111)

N = 4*x2 + 2*x1 + 1*x0 

Vout = Vref * ((x2/2) + (x1/4) + (x0/8)) = Vref * ((4*x2 + 2*x1 + x0)/8)

MSB for x2 is 4/7

MSB for x1 is 2/7

MSB for x0 is 1/7

```

The total output volatage is a linear combination of the bits, the output voltage is proportional to the value represented by the vector X.

### Part 3

#### Report

The project consists of two parts, one using c code and freeRTOS and the other part using microPython and a mqtt broker. Both parts of the project uses the same components but second part is connected to the a network and has the possibility to communicat with other devices while the first one can't. The first part of the project is to implement code so that when a button is pressed a led is turned on for 2 seconds and the message "Button pressed!" is printe. while that is happening another task is run where every 5 seconds a measurement of a dht11 sensor is taken and the temperature and humidity is printed unless there is an error. The second part of the project is to implement code so that a raspberry pi pico w can connect to a mqtt server and using the connection the controller can read and publish data. If a button press is detected the raspberry should send a signal to the mqtt server and when the signal is then received by the microcontroller it should turn a led on and take meassurements of the temperature and humidity with a dht11 sensor and publish the data. When the new data is published the led should turn off. There is also a timer that counts to 5 minutes and then publishes a signal to the mqtt server and the timer then restarts so that after another 5 minutes a new signal is sent.

The real-time requirement for the project is on the button press where a manual input is used and the system needs to have a fast respons. You could have a system like the project but it has more critical functions like a fire alarm or a medical alarm at a hospital where response times are important. Then RTOS is a necessaty because it needs to have a fast response time and a program written in microPython or normal c whould not be fast enough. So in systems where the response time to an event is not critical its okey to use microPython but if the system is critical RTOS should be used to insure a fast response.

After desiding what the project should be i started by finding wiring diagrams for the different components and then connecting the different components on a breadboard. After the different components where connected i started programming the components to work one by one. When the components worked i started looking in to how to connect to a network. When connected to a network i started looking for a mqtt server that could be used and when one was found i looked for how i could connect to the server. When connected to the mqtt server i start looking at how to publish and read data on the server before implementing it with fake data to be sent. When the sent data can be read i started implementing a method for when a specific value is read the led is turned on and the dht11 sensor takes a meassurement and publishes the temperature and humidity. When the value of the dht sensor then was read from the mqtt server the led is turned off. When that part was done i went on to implement that on a button press the specifik value should be sent to the mqtt server. After that i started taking the time of when a publication was made to have regular updated data on an interval.

Save the following code on the raspberry pi pico as umqtt.py by copying the code or downloding the file from [https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib/blob/master/micropython/umqtt.simple/umqtt/simple.py](https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib/blob/master/micropython/umqtt.simple/umqtt/simple.py) and rename it to umqtt.py

#### Code

The js below is the code for the uplink decoder.

```JS

function Decoder(topic, payload) {
    try {
        // Parse the JSON payload
        payload = JSON.parse(payload);
        
        // Extract temperature and humidity
        var Temp = payload.t;  // Temperature
        var Hum = payload.h;   // Humidity
        
        return [
            {
                device: "77870f9d-679b-4a1e-aa90-b626cc8fc7ab", // Serial Number or Device ID
                field: "TEMP",
                value: Temp
            },
            {
                device: "77870f9d-679b-4a1e-aa90-b626cc8fc7ab", // Serial Number or Device ID
                field: "HUM",
                value: Hum
            }
        ];
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Failed to decode payload:", error);
        return [];  // Return an empty array if decoding fails
