## Description and background of idea
The concept is to develop a website that provides information about the number of people standing in line at Sivans. It will aid the public in getting an estimate of how many people are currently waiting in line and also allow them to access the historical data of the number of people in the line during specific hours. 

The idea behind this project is to assist students in particular who are interested in knowing how long the line is at Sivans. This will enable them to plan when they should start lining up and when they should avoid it.

## Bill of Material (utrustningslista)
 - Raspberry pi pico x2
 - Ultra sonic sensor x2

## General requirements (kravspecifikation, övergripande)
The system should do the following:
- Calculate an approximate number of lines filled
- Present these results on a website
- Display graphs of previous weeks results
## Time schedule, weekly
