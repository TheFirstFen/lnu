- Allows for pattern detection (e.g., multiple errors in a short time) which can help prevent cascading failures.

**Cons:**

- Increased bandwidth and processing resources for real-time logging, especially during high-error periods.
- Potential risk if centralized logging becomes unavailable during critical failures.

##### **Our choice: 

***TODO Motivation***
Real-time error logging to a centralized monitoring and alert system for better response times and visibility into system health.**

#### QAS 2 : Data Modification

### Security

### Requirements TODO

#### QAS 1 : Unauthorized Access Attempt 

***TODO Description***

**Source**: Unidentified User / User.

**Stimulus**: Attempts to access restricted resources, (employee dashboard).

**Artifact**: Access control systems (Authentication & Authorization).

**Environment**: The system is operational and user only has user-rights.

**Response**: System detects user-rights, denies the request, logs the attempt for security monitoring.

#### QAS 2 : Multiple Failed Login Attempts

***TODO Description***

**Source**: Unidentified User.

**Stimulus**: Multiple failed login attempts to an account.

**Artifact**: Login System (Authentication & Identification, account management, servers and logging).

**Environment**: The system is operational and functioning normally.

**Response**: After set amount of attempts blocks further login attempts, attempts are logged for security monitoring.

**Response Measure**: Locks the account, sends security alert to user email to be able to unlock account, this with a 100% prevention rate of unauthorized access to a users account.

 #### QAS 3 : Denial of Service Protection

 ***TODO Description***

**Stimulus**: X amount of requests per second, overloading the system (X >= 1000).

**Artifact**: Servers, traffic controller and logging.

**Environment**: The system is operational but slow (under a (D)DoS attack).

**Response**: System detects abnormal traffic patterns, limits requests and diverts the abnormal traffic to a backup server with limited resources.
