## Problem 1

- T1-1 
    - ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
        
        A protocol used to map a network address like an IP address to a physical address (MAC address) on a local network.

    - DNS (Domain Name System)
        
        A system that translates human-readable domain names like "www.example.com" into IP addresses.

    - TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
        
        A connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable data transmission by establishing a connection and performing error checking.

    - TLSv1.2 / TLSv1.3 (Transport Layer Security)
        
        Protocols that provide secure communication over a computer network by encrypting data. TLSv1.3 is the more recent and secure version compared to TLSv1.2.

    - ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
        
        A network layer protocol used for diagnostic and error reporting, such as pinging to test connectivity.

    - QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections)
        
        A transport layer protocol designed by Google that aims to reduce latency and improve connection speeds, using UDP instead of TCP.

    - UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
        
        A connectionless protocol that sends data without establishing a reliable connection, often used for streaming or real-time communications.

    - WLCCP (Wireless LAN Context Control Protocol)
        
        A protocol used in wireless networks to manage the context information of mobile clients, primarily in Cisco wireless systems.

- T1-2 
    - IPv4 conversations: 81

    - IPv6 conversations: 1 

    - DNS Server IP: 172.25.8.8 (Which I assume to be the router due to it having the websites that I visited cached)

    TODO: Briefly explain your reasoning as to why there is a different amount of IPv4 and IPv6 conversations and explain why this DNS server is used. 

- T1-3 
    - QUIC
        
        A transport layer protocol designed by Google that aims to reduce latency and improve connection speeds, using UDP instead of TCP.

    - DNS
        
        A system that translates human-readable domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses.

## Problem 2 

- T2-1 
    - My computers IP: 172.27.140.238

    - Other IPs:

        172.25.8.8 
    
        142.250.74.100
    
        128.119.245.12

    - Observation of request:
        
        Using `GET` on URI `/wireshark-labs/HTTP-wireshark-file1.html` and specifying request version as `HTTP/1.1`. 

- T2-2 
    - Status Code: 200 (OK)
        
        Refers to the request being accepted and going through.

    - Content Length: 128
        
        Refers to the size of the response.

    - Wed, 20 Nov 2024 06:59:01 GMT
        
        Refers to the last time the file was modified.
