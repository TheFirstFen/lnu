# Sum of Three Digits

This Python program prompts the user to enter a three-digit number and then calculates the sum of the digits.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. The program starts by importing the `int` function from the `math` module. This function is used to convert a string to an integer.
2. The program then prompts the user to enter a three-digit number. The user's input is stored in the variable `var`.
3. The program then uses the `//` operator to extract the first, second, and third digits of the number. The first digit is stored in the variable `digit_1`, the second digit is stored in the variable `digit_2`, and the third digit is stored in the variable `digit_3`.
4. The program then uses the `+` operator to add the three digits together. The sum is stored in the variable `total`.
5. The program then uses the `print` function to display the sum of the three digits.
