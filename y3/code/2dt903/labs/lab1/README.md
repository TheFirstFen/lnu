In order to determine whether we can reconstruct the original signal after discretization, we need to apply the **Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem**. This theorem states that for a signal to be perfectly reconstructed from its samples, the sampling rate must be at least **twice** the maximum frequency present in the signal. In other words, if \( f_{\text{max}} \) is the maximum frequency in the signal, the sampling rate \( f_s \) must satisfy the condition:

\[
f_s \geq 2 \cdot f_{\text{max}}
\]

### Given Information:
- The signal \( x(t) \) consists of sine waves with frequencies: 1.75 kHz, 2 kHz, and 3 kHz.
- The sampling rate \( f_s = 5 \) kHz.

### Maximum Frequency in the Signal:
The highest frequency component in the signal is 3 kHz.

### Nyquist Criterion:
According to the Nyquist-Shannon theorem, the minimum sampling rate required to reconstruct the signal is:

\[
f_s \geq 2 \cdot f_{\text{max}} = 2 \cdot 3 \text{ kHz} = 6 \text{ kHz}
\]

However, the given sampling rate is 5 kHz, which is **less than** the required 6 kHz. This means that the sampling rate does **not satisfy** the Nyquist criterion.

### Conclusion:
Since the sampling rate of 5 kHz is less than the required 6 kHz, we will not be able to perfectly reconstruct the original signal. **Aliasing** will occur, which means that higher frequency components (like the 3 kHz component) will be "folded" into lower frequencies, distorting the signal after discretization.
