# Square Color

This Python program takes a chess square identifier as input and outputs the color of the square.

## Step-by-step explanation

The program first takes a chess square identifier as input. The input is a string that consists of a letter and a number. The letter represents the file (column) of the square, and the number represents the rank (row) of the square.

For example, the input "a1" represents the square in the first rank and first file. The input "h8" represents the square in the eighth rank and eighth file.
