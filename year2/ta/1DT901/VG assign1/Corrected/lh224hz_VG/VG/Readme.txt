    I solved the problem by using %(module) and //(Floor  division). The code works but is not optimal, its really ugly and
    could be done better. The code itself is quite simple i let the user input (Payment) and (Cost). I then print the total change,
    and gave all our different bills short names (a,b,c.....) to simplyfy the writing of the code. I printed out the result
    by using many prints but later on saw that the code on display prints it in one line with n\.


    VG: squarecolor.py

    I solved the problem by using two lists, the lists is divided by what color the x1 has(x = variable for letters).
    I then used index to figure out what letter and number was entered. The different lists has different colors for even and odd numbers.
    So by knowing the starting color i could use %(module) to see if the number was even, and else make it the other color.


    VG: sumofthree.py

    I solved the problem by using %(module) and //(floor division). The user can input a 3 digit number. The program divides these
    in to hundreds, tens, ones. Then adds these the together.

    VG: tax.py

    I solved the problem by using if and elif statements. The user gets to input their salary, the program checks if the salary
    is higher, lower or = to the different limits. If the salary is detected to be in range of the if statement it multiplyes it by
    the tax for that taxbraket and prints the number.
