1.)change.py
I solved this problem through excluding the bills with the highest value and then moving to the ones with lower value.

2.)squarecolor.py
Making sure that non-existing tiles will be excluded was the first step, the second step was figuring out a pattern that suits this problem.

3.)sumofthree.py
Separating all digits from the number using Integer Division and Modulus and then saving the three digits each in its own variable and lastely adding them together.

4.)tax.py
Understanding how taxes work; using if-statements and elif-statements for the sake of taxing different incomes depending on their value.
