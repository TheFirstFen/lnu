sumofthree.py : 
divided the number by 100 and rounded it to get first digit, then divided by 10 and substracted the first digit * 10 to get second digit, then substracted the firs and second digits * 10 from the original number to get the last digit, and then added them together

change.py :
started with rounding the price to get an integer number and then calculated the change, then made 2 arrays one to get modified (change array) and one to be printed ([1000]kr bills ... etc)
made a for loop that loops through the changeArray, in it made an if statement to check if the change is higher or equal the bills in the array, if the statement is true the array index will change value to the change divided by that index and then the change will have that bill(s) substracted from its value, if the bill is higher it will change to 0.
after that both arrays get printed respectively.

tax.py :
a simple if elif statements, checking for the income range and calculating the tax, if below 38000 take 30% off, if in range 38000 and 50000 take 30% off 38000 and 35% of the rest, if higher than 50000 take 30% off 38000 and 35% of the rest to 50000 and 40% of the rest

squarecolor.py :
made 2 arrays one for letters and one for numbers, I noticed a patteren if we start counting from 1 on both arrays, if the both odd or even they always give black if different they give white, so made a for loop and went throu«µh them to check for the input and saved the results in a new array. made a simple if statement to check if they should be black or white.
