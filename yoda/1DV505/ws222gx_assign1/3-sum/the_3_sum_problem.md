# The 3-sum problem
## William Schr√∂der

## I. Introduction
This report will detail what the 3-sum problem is, how the 3-sum problem can be solve using various of algorithms. Finally it will involve experiments showing how diffrent algorithms are faster than others.

### A. Problem Formulation
The 3-sum problem works like this: given a N size list of integers find all the combinations of 3 pairs that sum up to a given target. Where each instance of triplet has to be unique meaning that (5, 3, 2) is the same triplet as (2, 3, 5) and (3, 5, 2).

### B. Experminetal Setup
The experiments were conducted on a **Lenovo ideapad 5 pro** that has a AMD Ryzen 7 5000th series. When comparing the algorithms against each other the algorithms will have been ran on the same size list and with the same elements in that list.
