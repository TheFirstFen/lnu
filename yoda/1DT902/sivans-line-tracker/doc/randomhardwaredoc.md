vecka 48:
- planned the hardware:
- - One camera taking pictures of the line. 
- - Image rendering using a color mask to determine the length of the queue.
- - Raspberry pico sitting at a high place connected to a powerbank with the camera.
- - Uses a LoRa-extention to send data to server.
vecka 49:
- Replanned the hadware:
- - One ultrasound-sensor sending pulses of ultrasound measuring the distance to the closest person in the line.
- - Code on the raspberry pico to determine the length of the queue depending on the result of the ultrasound-sensor.
- Connected the sensor and noticed the sensor only measures up to 5 meters.
vecka 50:
- Re-replanning the hardware:
- - Two ultrasound-sensors on one pico each. 
- - Uses the school wifi to send data.
vecka 51:
- Wrote code to send info to the webserver.
- Started testing sending results.
vecka 52: 
- Connected the pico to a powerbank.
- Having a headache because of the powerbank.
- Writing code for a better sleep for the pico.
- Noticing the better sleep doesn't work through thonny.
vecka 1:
- Sending dummy data to try out the database.
- Making a chassi for the raspberry pico.
